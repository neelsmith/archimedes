Gather the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Let's assume you have n vertices, and the coordinates are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn).
Find the midpoint of any two consecutive vertices. The midpoint can be calculated using the following formulas:
Midpoint X-coordinate = (x1 + x2) / 2
Midpoint Y-coordinate = (y1 + y2) / 2
Calculate the slopes of the lines connecting the midpoints of consecutive sides. The slope can be calculated using the formula:
Slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Find the perpendicular bisectors of each side of the polygon. The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that is perpendicular to the segment and passes through its midpoint. The equation of a line with a given slope passing through a point (x, y) is given by:
y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.
Using the midpoint and slope, you can calculate the equation of the perpendicular bisector for each side of the polygon.
Solve the equations of the perpendicular bisectors simultaneously to find their point of intersection. This point represents the center of the circumcircle.
Calculate the distance between the center point and any vertex of the polygon. This distance is the radius of the circumcircle.
The equation of the circumcircle can be expressed as:
(x - center_x)^2 + (y - center_y)^2 = radius^2, where (center_x, center_y) is the center point of the circumcircle, and radius is the distance between the center point and any vertex.
